# Hey, I'm Pravir.

I build AI systems, search infrastructure, and developer tooling. Most of my work sits somewhere between software engineering and applied machine learning.

### What I’m working on:
- recommendation systems for procurement applications
- improving LLM workflows and orchestration  
- backend engineering around pipelines, data flow, and system reliability  

### What I’m learning next:
- CUDA programming
- AI agents and multi-step reasoning systems 

For the past 1.5 years, I’ve been an AI/ML intern at SAP Ariba working on semantic search, internal AI tooling, and scalable pipelines used across engineering teams.
